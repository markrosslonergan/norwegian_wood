1. detector.h, functions.c, params.h, genie_tau_test.c, do not need to be changed unless necessary.


2. Genie events gst files are in gst0to40 directory. (Generated within )0 to 40 GeV beam energy).


3. In order to run/generate nue appearance channel CC histograms, go into 'genie_CC.c' and adjust input gst file then you can do


root -l
.L genie_CC.c
run_all_genie_study();







root -l
.L genie_CC.c
genie_study()
MARK: now run_all_genie_study(); This runs all CC and NC nue backgrounds


This will generate a output file in /gst0to40/out directory

4. In order to run/generate nue appearance channel NC histograms, go into 'genie_CC.c' and adjust input gst file then you can do

root -l
.L genie_CC.c
genie_NC()

This will generate a output file in /gst0to40/out directory





5. In order to run/generate numu dis. channel CC & NC histograms, go into 'genie_mu.c' and adjust input gst file then you can do


root -l
.L genie_mu.c
genie_mu()

This will generate a output file in /gst0to40/out directory



6. For stacked histograms, go into 'plotfunctions.c', stack_study() is supposed to spit out nue channel stack, stack_mu() is supposed to spit out numu channel stack.


By running,


root -l
.L plotfunctions.c
stack_study() or stack_mu()


You will get a TCanvas.

6.1 Histograms are supposed to be normalized properly with respect to their event rates and generated # of events. The normalization factors in 'plotfunctions.c' are regarding 10k genie events. Thus if you are using 50k size gst, the factor should be divided by 5. stack_study() and stack_mu() should be already taking care of this.
